      Uneri is a <strong>crystallised mineral</strong> whose discovery was made shortly after the <a href="epochshift.html">Epoch Shift</a>. Unlike the other changes, that happened on a global scale, Uneri appeared to be native to Heiwa’s islands. Discovered by an unlucky soul in <span style="color:#fce09d;">12 AES</span> in a cave deep underground, it had the tricky appearance of <strong>chalcopyrite</strong> but possessed a few physical traits of <strong>pyrite</strong>. When this crystal is struck against - or by - metal/concrete, it emits a yellow-tinted spark. If struck hard enough, this spark will mimic more of a non-dangerous explosion which doesn’t cause any damage but will emit a soft smoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      This mineral is <strong>toxic to touch</strong>, skin absorbent of the toxic material that coats the surface. The smoke that is emitted from the explosion is also toxic to inhale. Despite it being officially classified as "toxic", it does not directly cause harm or sickness; instead, it appears to cause some sort of innate power to develop in the person who came into contact with it. A <i>lot</i> is still unknown about the mineral itself, but it is believed to cause biological mutations to several areas of D.N.A - <strong>no consistency has yet been identified</strong>.

        You cannot have multiple powers as a result of Uneri. Any attempt to do so is excruciatingly painful due to attempts to manipulate and transform the person's DNA. It will always fail.

    </div>

    <p>
      Uneri doesn’t break upon impact, however the energy within it is drained after a single touch or strike. The rock loses its golden glow and instead is replaced by a muted yellow tint; this means that it is a <strong>one use rock</strong>, but can be kept as a souvenir of sorts without it being dangerous. That being said, it is also extremely fragile: it cannot be made into armor or weapons and a few good strike would cause it to shatter relatively easily.

        <p>
          The powers granted by this mineral still use a person’s mana reserve. However, the alteration to the person’s D.N.A causes their natural mana amount to increase by <strong>+[NUMBER TBD]</strong>.

            This type of Uneri power would cause a person’s DNA to mutate extensively, changing their outward appearance usually to something else entirely. An example of this would be someone’s appearance shifting to be more like a humanoid animal, or partially having animal appearance in combination with animal traits or instincts. 
          </td>
          <td>
            This is usually a mix being mutations and manipulations. For example, a change in appearance for either cosmetic reasons or for reasons that have a slight/minimal impact on the person, in combination with an ability that can be used similarly to regular magic (but it is directly connected to the person themselves).
          </td>
          <td>
            This type of ability allows for a person to temporarily transform into a different state of being. This tends to drain more mana than others. 
          </td>
          <td>
            This is an ability that has no physical mutations whatsoever and simply acts like regular magic. It only appears outwardly this way, as all Uneri magic is individual and unique to the person and is connected to their being.

        This is a form of Uneri that is much less stable than the regular mineral. There are two possible outcomes of this that are determined through dice rolls made by <strong>staff</strong> during IRP events. These can only be initiated by <strong>Owners and Admins</strong>. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In the situation of an event, a person will be prompted to roll a 1d20 if they come into contact with Unstable Uneri.

            <td>
              Rolling a <strong>16 or above</strong> will result in success. The regular effect of Uneri will occur.
            </td>
            <td>
              Rolling a <strong>15 or below</strong> will result in failure: the mineral will fuse into the wrist of the person, and cause a life-long incurable curse to overtake them. The player can determine this curse, but it must be run through staff in submission first.
